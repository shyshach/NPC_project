Web application for project management. 
I am looking for a C# .Net developer who will write a web application as soon as possible.
It is not a commercial project, so requirements is not very high.

Project should be written on C#, using ASP. Net MVC and Entity Framework Core(for a database).
Functionality should be at least partially covered by unit tests.
In the project must be 3 types of roles: user; teacher; student.
Structure of the project:
1) Sign up page.
User can sign up as teacher or as student.
2) Login page.
User can log in as teacher or as student. 
3) Room creation page.
This page must be available for teacher only.
Here can create a "room" to manage development of the project.
Each room must have 5 parameters:
- project name.
- students fullname (fullname of a student-developer).
- year (year of the course when student develop his project).
- type of the project (it must diploma or course project).
- status of project (finished or not).
When creating a room teacher must fill fields:
1. project name
2. students fullname
3.  year
4. type of the project
5. student email ( to invite student to the room)
Projects can be searched.
Projects can be deleted.
4) Room page ( it is available both for teacher and student)
Here must be 3 tabs:
a) 1st tab - attachment tab.
Here teacher can add attachments ( some helpful info, books or any materials to ease studying).
Files with  .txt ; .doc ; .docx ; .pdf must be supported.

A simple board like on Trello or Jira to manage development circle.

So student can easily communicate with teacher.
